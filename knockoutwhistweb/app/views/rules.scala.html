            <td>Dog Life</td>
            <td>The first player who takes no tricks is awarded a "dog's life". In the next hand, that player is dealt one card and can decide which trick to play it to. Each time a trick is played the "dog" may either play the card or knock on the table and wait to play it later. If the dog wins a trick, the player to the left leads to the next and the dog re-enters the game properly in the next hand. If the dog fails, they are knocked out.</td>
